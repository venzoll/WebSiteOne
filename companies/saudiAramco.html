          <h2>Saudi Aramco history</h2>

          <p>
            Saudi Aramco has a rich history that spans nearly a century. Here's
            a brief overview of its key milestones: 1933: Saudi Aramco is
            founded as a partnership between the Saudi Arabian government and
            the American oil company Standard Oil of California (SoCal). 1938:
            Oil is discovered in commercial quantities in the Dhahran region,
            leading to the establishment of the first commercial oil well in
            Saudi Arabia. 1950: Saudi Arabia acquires a 25% stake in Saudi
            Aramco, increasing its ownership in the company. 1973: Saudi Arabia,
            along with other oil-producing nations, institutes an oil embargo,
            leading to a significant increase in oil prices and increasing Saudi
            Aramco's importance in the global oil market. 1980s: Saudi Aramco
            takes full control of its operations and facilities, acquiring the
            remaining stake held by its American partners. 2016: Saudi Aramco
            unveils its financial data for the first time, indicating its status
            as one of the world's most profitable companies. 2019: Saudi Aramco
            goes public with an initial public offering (IPO), becoming the
            largest IPO in history at the time. Saudi Aramco's history is marked
            by its evolution from a small exploration venture to one of the
            largest and most influential energy companies globally, underpinning
            the Saudi Arabian economy and the global oil industry.
