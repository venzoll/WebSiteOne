            Alphabet Inc. is a multinational conglomerate based in Mountain
            View, California, USA. It was established in 2015 as part of a
            corporate restructuring of Google. Alphabet serves as the parent
            company of Google and several other subsidiaries. Google, the most
            prominent subsidiary, focuses on internet-related services and
            products, including the search engine, advertising, and cloud
            computing. Alphabet's diverse portfolio also includes companies
            working on projects such as self-driving cars, life sciences, and
            urban development. The restructuring allowed Alphabet to better
            manage its various business ventures and investments, with a focus
            on innovation and technology.

          <h2>Alphabet history</h2>

          <p>
            Alphabet Inc.'s history is a relatively short but impactful one:
            2015: Alphabet Inc. is established as part of a corporate
            restructuring of Google. Larry Page becomes the CEO of Alphabet, and
            Sundar Pichai becomes the CEO of Google. 2016: Waymo, a subsidiary
            of Alphabet, is created to develop autonomous vehicle technology.
            2018: Loon, a subsidiary focused on providing internet access via
            high-altitude balloons, is launched. 2019: Alphabet becomes the
            fourth publicly traded U.S. company to achieve a market
            capitalization of over $1 trillion. 2020: Alphabet-owned Google
            announces a quantum computer breakthrough with "quantum supremacy."
            Alphabet's history is characterized by its efforts to expand beyond
            its core search and advertising businesses into areas like
            autonomous vehicles, life sciences, and quantum computing, all while
            maintaining a strong presence in the technology industry.
